# PulseRamp
A small tool that converts TTL pulses into stretched versions of themselves with user defined ramp-up and ramp-down times. Useful for electrophysiological recordings that are combined with optogenetically activation neurons, as the stimulating light pulse will lead to artifacts in the recording caused by the opto-electric effect. As the lights intensity ramps in smoothly, this artifact is reduced.

Based on a Teensy 3.5, 2-channels.
